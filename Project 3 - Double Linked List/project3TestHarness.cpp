/* Project Description: 
Here we using an doubly-linked list structure to create an array like list which can be useful to do dynamic insert
and delete/removal of elements. Using class sequence and sequence node the doubly-linked list is created when each function is called, the
objects in class sequence are created and based on function calling, the nodes with its element values are either inserted, deleted or queried.
To ensure that the insert and removal works fine we are using error handling, where we use exception to ensure that the access of elements is 
not wrong. try, catch are used to see the exceptions generated while passing invalid arguments or values. All the values that are inserted will
create as a node in the heap and we use the destructor to delete the nodes in heap to avoid memory leaks. All the values inserted are created 
in form of chain in the heap connecting to and fro, and object in stack is connected to head and tail of this link thus allowing us for
dynamic insertion or removal at any position of the link.

This project contains three files. sequnce.h is the header file given by the professor which contains the
classes, functions declarations, its purposes saying what each function should do and attributes declarations.
sequence.cpp file contains the function definitions or implementation, the functions that should be used are listed by the professor,
we need to write the code or define the functions so their usage works well when called in the main program.
project3TestHarness.cpp is the mainprogram file written and shared by professor, once all our function definitions are correct and tested,
we will run the main harness file and ensure everything is working properly.*/
